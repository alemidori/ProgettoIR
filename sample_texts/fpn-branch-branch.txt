FOREWORD.
THIS little book is written for my children and the descendants of those whose lives are herein chronicled.
From its perusal may they learn still more to reverence the memory of their forefathers, and to prize the heritage left by them of noble and honorable lives.
To this record I have added my memories of the home of my youth, under Southern skies. Then later the experiences of a Southern woman during the Civil War, “within the lines.”
This long retrospect of mine, a retrospect of eighty years, portrays faithfully life in the South as it was in ante-bellum times, and afterward in her mourning vestments, the beautiful, heroic South.
I write with a loving hand as I pay this tribute to the past.
