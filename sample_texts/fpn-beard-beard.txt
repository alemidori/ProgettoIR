PREFACE.
IF THE public will allow me, I will preface my narrative by stating why I write the following.
During the summer of 1896, while watching by the bedside of my eldest son, who was suffering from a severe attack of typhoid fever, I dropped into a doze, and while passing a few moments in this way dreamed of spending the night at the old Crumpler homestead in Germanton, Stokes County, N. C.
Just a few minutes previous to retiring someone rapped upon the door. On opening it I beheld standing before me two of my dead-and-gone ancestors. I recognized them at once as being Grandfather and Cousin Newton Crumpler. The former passed away when my father was only six years of age. The latter was shot and fell mortally wounded while serving in the “Seven Days Fight” in and around Richmond, Va.
Cousin Newton was one of North Carolina's famous lawyers, and had he survived the cruel war would have made his mark as a military man also.
Upon entering the room Grandfather drew me to his knee and began stroking my hair, at the same time saying, “Well, well, this is my little grandchild and Jimmy's baby.” He then asked me to tell him something of my life. I told him all until I reached my eighteenth birthday. There I paused and could go no further; so Grandfather said, “That will do, Cousin Nute has already told me the rest, and I see that my little girl has had ups and downs as well as we older ones. But now listen carefully to what old Grandpa has to say: He has returned, bringing with him good news for his little one and she shall once more be happy.”
