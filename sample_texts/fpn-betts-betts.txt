INTRODUCTION.
HISTORY rightly defined is more than a narration of events transpiring within certain periods of the Calendar. That most useful of the sciences deals with the philosophy and results of occurrences, deriving therefrom an array of principles which form a part of the world's necessary and priceless treasure. The historian takes the crude materials time pours into his hands, digests, filters and refines the mass, thereby securing the simplest and most serviceable products. These he places on the market where buyers always wait, eager and affluent. Artists and artisans these buyers are, who for their own and others' wellbeing build structures, weave fabrics, or portray the perfect pattern.
The chronicles of a Confederate Chaplain's diary will doubtless furnish the staple for weaving a most engaging story when the true historian shall find them.
The perusal of these plain annals will surely revive in the memory of many a Confederate Veteran the vivid panorama of that unequalled and heroic struggle for the perpetuation of certain principles that underlie the purest and best form of government in the estimation of loyal Southrons.
It is devoutly desired that all who may trace the indentures of this diary will reflect gratefully upon the allwise and gracious providence of God that seeks to save even unto the uttermost. It is believed that many persons, at home and in the army, were led to accept Christ as their Saviour, who under other circumstances might never have known His forgiving love.
